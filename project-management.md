# Initial Starting Plan

1. Separation of Concerns
    - TrelloAPI - "Talks to Trello's servers" (Create a interface for this for testing later)
    - MarkdownParser - "Converts between markdown and board objects"  
    - FileHandler - "Reads and writes markdown files"
    - SyncCoordinator - "Orchestrates the sync process"
2. Error Handling Strategy
    Main things that can go wrong:
        - Network errors (API down) → retry 'x' amount of times and inform user
        - File errors → show clear message and exit
        - Parse error → Show which line is broken
        - Sync conflicts → For MVP just overwrite
3. Testing Strategy
    - MarkdownParser: has lots of edge cases 
    - SyncCoordinator: core logic
